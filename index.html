                This project was initiated to reduce the operational burden of
                alert resolution on service owners, enabling them to prioritize
                feature development and automation initiatives. It introduced a
                robust control plane for alert management, providing both
                semi-automated and fully automated resolution capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The semi-automated workflows guide users through the resolution
                process with minimal effort, requiring only basic configuration
                inputs. The fully automated workflows extract critical details
                from alerts and execute predefined Standard Operating Procedures
                (SOPs).
              </p>
              <p>Key features of this control plane includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Enhanced Security:</b> Leveraging the Principles of Least
                  Privilege to minimize the risk of production resource
                  mishandling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Comprehensive Audit and Tracking:</b> Ensuring transparency
                  and accountability by maintaining a detailed log of user
                  actions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Proactive Monitoring:</b> Facilitating metric collection
                  for early detection and resolution of potential issues. This
                  solution streamlines alert management while ensuring
                  operational safety, transparency, and efficiency.
